# PHP Project with SQL Database

This is a PHP project that includes an SQL database, PHP files, and an index.html file. The purpose of this project is to create a functional database with the ability to display and sort data with the click of a button.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Apache and MySQL servers installed and running on your local machine. You can download and install Apache and MySQL servers from the following websites:

- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

You can also use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Once you have Apache and MySQL servers installed and running, you can clone the repository or download the files directly to your local machine.

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:


```console
git clone git@bitbucket.org:filipd815/revpanda-php-assessment.git 
```

## Usage
To use this project, firstly run the app.php file to install a DB, then simply open the index.html file in your web browser while running Apache and MySQL servers.

The index.html file contains a page with three input fields, labeled "A," "B," and "C." These input fields are used to save data to the corresponding database tables.

There are also five buttons on the page:

1. **Display A Table**: This button, when pressed, displays all values from the "A" table.
2. **Display ABC Tables**: This button, when pressed, displays all values from the "A," "B," and "C" tables in that order.
3. **Display CB Tables**: This button, when pressed, displays all values from the "C" and "B" tables in that order.
4. **Sort B Table (Ascending)**: This button, when pressed, displays all values from the "B" table sorted in ascending order.
5. **Sort B Table (Descending)**: This button, when pressed, displays all values from the "B" table sorted in descending order. 
 
The front-end of the project has a minimalistic yet appealing design, and the code structure follows best practices for PHP projects.

## Requirements
- PHP version must be PHP 7.2 or higher.

- Frameworks are not allowed.

- The Project must be working just by opening the index.html file (while running Apache and MySQL servers as well).
